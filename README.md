### Code

The main code is in the `script.js` file. It sets up a Three.js scene with a camera and a D20 dice. The dice is an `Icosahedron`.
The dice is animated to continuously rotate. When the user clicks on the screen or presses the Enter key, the dice is rolled. The rotation speed increases during the roll.

The dice also moves to follow the mouse movement.

### Usage

To use this project, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You will see a D20 dice continuously rotating.

To roll the dice, click on the screen or press the Enter key. A dialog box will appear asking you to choose the type of dice (D6, D8, D10, D12, or D20) and enter a modifier value (optional). The result of the roll will be displayed in an alert.
